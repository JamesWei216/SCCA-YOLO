# SCCA-YOLO
Codes for my paper"SCCA-YOLO: Spatial channel collaborative attention yolo for highway autonomous driving".

The entire code is coming soon...

# Abstract
By using the spatial and channel collaborative attention mechanism to improve the detection effect of the YOLO algorithm, we have achieved good performance on our own dataset. Next, we will verify it on more public datasets.
